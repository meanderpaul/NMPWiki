            <p><h2>Welcome to NMP Resources!</h2>

Since its inception in 2019, the Nordic Mythology Podcast has become a beacon of accurate information and engaging discussions about Nordic Mythology and the Viking Age. 
Hosted initially by Daniel Farrand, owner of Horns of Odin, and Dr. Mathias Nordvig, a respected scholar in Nordic studies, the podcast was born out of a shared frustration with the 
widespread misuse and misrepresentation of these fascinating historical topics.

After three years and over 130 episodes, Dr. Nordvig departed the podcast to explore new endeavors. Daniel, with his insatiable curiosity, continued the journey solo. 
Episode 163 marked a pivotal moment when Margrethe Havgar joined Daniel as a co-host, bringing new energy and insights to the show. 
Her impressive contributions in the longest episode in NMP history made her the perfect addition.

Beyond the hosts, NMP has built a beautiful community of listeners and is supported by an incredibly talented behind-the-scenes team, without whom the podcast simply couldn’t exist.
